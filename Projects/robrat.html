        <h2>
            Lore:
        </h2>
        <p>
            You are one of many security guards that work at pandora industries, which was abandoned in one reality where the US Government took control over all laboratories in their country.
            Your mission is to go into those abandoned laboratories, exterminate anomalous beings, and kill anyone that interferes with you and your friends.
        </p>

        <h2>
            Description:
        </h2>
        <p>
            This is a spinoff of a map that is currently being processed, which is dr_pandoralab (codenamed Labrat). But unlike dr_pandoralab, you are not in a deathrun where you have to go through traps that are being activated by death. 
            Instead, you have to survive by looting corpses and killing alien beings, as well as human forces, most specifically the Feds.
        </p>
        
        <h2>
            Features differing from dr_pandoralab:
        </h2>
        <p>
            This will be created in ROBLOX, a platform where players can have fun <strike>being banned for no reason</strike> and interact socially.<br>It will also include these following things:
            <li>A custom FPS Framework</li>
            <li>A loadout system</li>
            <li>A lobby where you can hang out and join</li>
            <li>Gamepasses and Developer products to boost your progress. <strike>(I need your money)</strike></li>
        </p>

        <h2>
            Why ROBLOX?
        </h2>
        <p>
            Personally, I do not like ROBLOX moderation, as it's because many players have been banned for weird reasons, and strangely, despite in fact they don't allow bullying and toxicity, there are many that keep up with this behavior. I might be making money off of it, only if it gets popular and I have so much robux, but I am simply doing this for fun (and that <b><i>juicy</i></b> revenue every ROBLOX developer is looking for).
            <p class = "spoiler">There is also a lot of Online Dating, which is a big issue since it could be done by predators to lure children. "What does it have to do with the game?" you might ask; It has a lobby. The lobby is built for players to come together and be friends. It's just like a hangout game basically, but it's for you to go in a random server. This method of bringing players to servers already exists in many games, such as Isle, Doors, and much more.</p>
            <p>But I am choosing this platform because it is somewhat easy making games in ROBLOX, as of now, I only know LUA, but at the end of the day, I will be learning more languages over time, specifically C#. (a Unity version might come. We'll never know...)</p>

            <b>DOORS</b><br>
            A horror game that gained popularity rather quickly. The functions of this game is basic, and is a trial-and-error game where you have to die to learn.
            The game that I'm making will also be a trial-and-error game; die to learn.
