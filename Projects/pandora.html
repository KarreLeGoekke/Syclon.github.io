        <h2>
            Lore:
        </h2>
        <p>
            You are a prisoner, and before that, you were arrested for countless murders (since you work for Mann. Co). The American feds decided to do a little test on you if you want freedom, however, it's not guaranteed.
            You have been sent to an abandoned lab somewhere in Sweden where every machine and trap still functions, and was used to primarily kill anomalies that try to invade the reality.
            One of your prisoners is sacrificed and they use the sacrificed body's soul to lure a scavenging creature that can control every machine. They took control of the creature and all you have to do is to escape the abandoned laboratory.<br>
            
            
        </p>
        <h2>
            Description:
        </h2>
        <p>
            This lore-filled deathrun map is currently in work-in-progress. When it's complete it will be pretty big, as it contains 6 paths which are 6 dimensions, as well as 2 extra dimensions. 
            And it's unfinished, VERY unfinished. In fact, I am planning to rework the lab itself, as well as I am "almost" done with the first dimension, which is the cave.<br>
        </p>
        <h2>WIP Boss: The Miner</h2>   
        <p>
            The miner is a boss that appears in the cave dimension. His abilities are smashing the ground and dropping stalactites from the ceiling. He spawns once someone gets into the spawn room, and he falls from the vent and attacks. His HP is 4 melee hits, and when he's hit, he will push away everyone near him and have a 15 second cooldown on being attacked again. 
            It means that it could take more than a minute to defeat him. When he is "killed", he returns to the vent, and the door ahead opens, taking you to another cave. 
            He then chases you down and makes stalactites fall on you, killing you if you get into the way of the stalactites, so you better look up!
        </p>

        <p>
            <b>DaimConneSDK</b><br>
            A mapper that focuses mostly on Trade and Deathrun maps, and also comes from the same country where dr_pandoralab takes place, as well as where I come from, Sweden. They make very good maps that can never disappoint you, and I one time met them too.<br>
            <i>(Fun fact: Daim is a popular Swedish chocolate brand)</i><br>
            <br>
            <b>Dr Face</b><br>
            A British mapper who is a <strike>furry</strike> very talented mapper, and made the dr_playstation map, as well as dr_safety_first. The deathrun map that I'm making is actually heavily inspired by dr_playstation, because it takes you to different dimensions.
